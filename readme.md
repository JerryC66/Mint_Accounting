This is a extremely simple bookkeeping app >_<
I mainly used Python PyQt6(.ui designed by Qtdesigner then transferred to .py and connected to main.py).It also involves database sqlite3(current learning). I also employ Qchart to visualize the analysis. 

I am a first year student from HUST.This is the first time for me to develop the whole software. And I strive to develop it in extremly limited time(5 days) Oh it is really a challenge but I really really learned a lot(thanks to a professional and patient teacher)

This app contains the following functions:   
1.Entrance:  log in\register
2.Adding: add new items,classification,money and so on 
3.History: show history, display past data
4.Analysis: data analysis ,pie chart,line chart
5.Settings: set limited amount(by day,month,year)

Attention: The codes doesn't contain some neccessay tools.So you need to install mamy Python packages(PyQt6,Qcharts......I install them in virtual envionment) please be patient wwwww
Thanks!!!
