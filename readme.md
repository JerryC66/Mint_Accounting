This is a extremely simple bookkeeping app >_<
I mainly used Python PyQt6(.ui designed by Qtdesigner then connected to .py).It also involves database(current learning). I also add Qchart to visualize the analysis. 
This app contains the following functions:   
1.Entrance:  log in\register
2.Adding: add new items,classification,money and so on 
3.History: show history, display past data
4.Analysis: data analysis ,pie chart,line chart
5.Settings: set limited amount(by day,month,year)
